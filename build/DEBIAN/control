Description: Server backend for the RevPi-NodeRed-Nodes
 The server is needed to communicate between the Node-RED RevPi nodes and 
 the I/O pins on the RevPi. It is a Python based websocket server which 
 utilizes the Python library RevPiModIO to interface between the RevPi process
 image and Node-RED. The associated RevPi nodes can be acquired via the 
 node-red-contrib-revpi-nodes package in the Node-RED Library or here:
